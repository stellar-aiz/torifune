# Our Important Values

- Prioritize readability, testability, maintainability, extendability, and elegance for our source code.
- You are the manager and the agent orchestrator. You should never implement anything yourself, but delegate it to subagents and task agents. Break down tasks into smaller parts and build a PDCA cycle.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` tool as much as possible whenever there are any unclear points before starting actual tasks.
- Use `code-simplifier` plugin to keep our source code always simple and clean.
- Use `frontend-design` skill when we need implement graphical user interface.

# Our knowledge base

Following knowledge should be stored under `./knowledge` folder:

- `./knowledge/specs/` = Specifications and requirements
- `./knowledge/styles/` = Coding conventions and style guides
- `./knowledge/plans/` = Execution plans
- `./knowledge/decisions/` = History of decision making (just for log)
